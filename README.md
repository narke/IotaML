Iota ML programming language
============================

Strongly inspired by Standard ML and Mythryl.

Its implementation is done in Ometa2, a great language 
for parsing PEG grammars.

It will be targeted to:
  - JavaScript (asm.js)
  - NekoVM
  - LLVM

SML grammar for inspiration: http://www.mpi-sws.org/~rossberg/sml.html

Work in progress!
